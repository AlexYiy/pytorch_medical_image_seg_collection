# Introduction
This project is a medical image segmentation template based on Pytorch implementation, which implements the basic and even most of the functions you need in medical image segmentation experiments. Such as data processing,data augmentation the design of loss, tool files, save and visualization of log, model files, training ,validation, test and project configuration.This project is inherited and improved by [Pytorch_Medical_Segmention_Template](https://github.com/FENGShuanglang/Pytorch_Medical_Segmention_Template).We added some commonly used segmentation networks and the latest modules including attention module, downsampling, upsampling, etc.
